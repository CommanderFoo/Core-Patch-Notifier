# Quick Start

If you want to get up and running quickly then follow the steps below.

1. Drag the `Patch Notifier` component into your hierarchy.
2. Create a leaderboard with 10 entries (lowest allowed) with "Higher is better", and drag it onto the `leaderboard` property.
3. Set the `admin_user` property to whoever you want to have permission to run the command.
4. Use `/patch` in chat to issue a patch notification.
