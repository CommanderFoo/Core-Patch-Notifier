These are the settings that can be found on the `Patch Notifier` folder in your hierarchy.

| Setting | Description |

| `leaderboard` | The leaderboard that will be used to store the timestamp for the patch notification. |
| `admin_user` | The username of the player who will have access to the `/patch` command to issue a new patch notification. |
| `notification_stay_time` | The duration of how long the patch notification will be displayed on screen to the user before it is removed. |
| `show_chat_message` | If enabled, then the patch notification will show in the chat to the player. |
| `show_notification` | If enabled, then the patch notification will show on screen to the player. |
| `poll_time` | This is how often the system will check to see if there is a new patch.  Default is 3 minutes (180 seconds).  Make sure to keep your patch time greater than your poll time, or the notification will never get seen. |
