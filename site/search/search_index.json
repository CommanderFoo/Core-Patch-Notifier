This command can only be used by the player who has been set as the admin_user . If no parameter is passed, then a default of 5 minutes will be used. The command has a second parameter where you can specify how much time to add (in seconds). So for example, if you use the command /patch 60 then all players currently playing your game will receive a notification, and any players that join your game before 60 seconds is up will also receive the notification. So let's say you are ready to update your game, but want to give players about 15 minutes warning that a patch will be deployed. You would join a server and issue the command /patch 900 . After 15 minutes you would then deploy your patch. Try not to deploy your patch before the notification time is up, otherwise players will still get a notification when they join your game after the patch is released.","title":"Patch Command"},{"location":"command/#patch-command","text":"To notify your players that a patch is being deployed soon you can use the /patch command in the Chat.

It's actually a very simple system that makes use of Leaderboards . When you issue the /patch command, a new timestamp (in the future) is submitted to the leaderboard. The leaderboard is then polled to see if there is a score that is greater than the current time. If there is, then we issue a notification to all players on the server. To prevent players constantly getting the notification, we store the current patch timestamp as a resource. The reason for this is so that the component doesn't mess with any player storage. It keeps things simple. The only downside is if he player leaves the server and rejoins, they will get the notification again. This I think is a fair tradeoff.","title":"How Does It Work?"},{"location":"how-does-it-work/#how-does-it-work","text":"It's actually a very simple system that makes use of Leaderboards .
